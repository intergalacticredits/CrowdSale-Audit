###  Files structure

A `.sol` file contain contract code.
A `.txt` file contain metadata

### Deployed contracts
Contracts are deployed on Mainnet and verified 
- `SafeMathLibExt`. The code of verified [SafeMathLibExt is here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcdcd0638664657Ed3B031A75e00E02e47057e226#code).
- `CrowdsaleTokenExt`. The token contract. The code of verified [CrowdsaleTokenExt is here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa5F8fC0921880Cb7342368BD128eb8050442B1a1#code).
- `FlatPricingExt`. The pricing strategy contract. The code of verified [FlatPricingExt is here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6692D5dD701b9373933730d4e4f3b498DB7F7C32#code).
- `MintedTokenCappedCrowdsaleExt`. The crowdsale contract for a tier. The code of verified [MintedTokenCappedCrowdsaleExt is here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3D5fb1E9d2F15D9ae5d7f4af4825FDEf03dE9685#code).

## Deployment stage

After all of the contracts are deployed next methods are executed at deployment stage:
- `setMintAgent` - sets `finalizeAgent` contract and crowdsale contract addresses as mint agents of token contract.
- `setFinalizeAgent` - sets `finalizeAgent` contract address as a finalize agent of the crowdsale contract.
- `setReleaseAgent` - sets `finalizeAgent` contract address as a release agent of token contract.
- `transferOwnership` - transfers ownership of token contract to the address that holds collected ether, which filled at step 2 of ICO Wizard.
